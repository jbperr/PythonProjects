# PythonProjects
Base code and results for my projects.

All visualizations can be found on benperry.org

### [McDonald's Biscuits and Gravy](https://www.benperry.org/mcbiscuit)
- Reverse-engineered McDonald's API to:
    - Determine menu item availability on a store-by-store basis 
    - Scrape store information:
        - Store location
        - Store hours
        - Store open date

Obscured the code to gather the store information due to it being collected with private API calls. Everything else is there including the actual store information.
### [Fast Food Location Scraping](https://www.benperry.org/stores)
- Expanded on the previous project to scrape the location data from most major food chains in the US
 - Currently have gathered info from 17 chains and over 65,000 individual stores.
 
Because this is just webscraping and not API calls, the code to gather all this is included as well as the data.
### [Airport Runway Alignment](https://www.benperry.org/airports)
- Using data from [OurAirports](https://ourairports.com/data/), the information of airports from around the world was analyzed.
- Using the heading information, the lat/long location of each runway, and some basic algebra I found all the runways in the world that line up with each other. Such that you could fly a plane from runway to runway with no turns. 
- DATA VISUAL WIP
- Current code up to date.
